# Ultraviolet

Based on the `default` skin from Fossil contributed by Ã‰tienne Deparis.

**Principles:**

- Dark mode. Taking inspiration from other sites' dark modes.
- Stylized.
- But, readable.
- Sober. Since the goal of this skin is to be used for all my projets, I will
  probably look at it frequently for the following years.
- Use <https://wildbit.com/blog/accessible-palette-stop-using-hsl-for-color-systems> for color design.

**Color palette:** *(Independent of Luminance, with Chroma variations)*

- #000000
- #4E00FF (purple blue)
- #B600FF (purple pink)
- #FF0000 (diff del)
- #00FF00 (diff ins)
- ~ #0000FF (diff edit)

## Syntax highlighting with PrismJS

The repository's unversioned files `.skin/prism.js` and `.skin/prism.css` are
used for syntax highlighting.
