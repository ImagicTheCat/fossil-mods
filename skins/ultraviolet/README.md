Based on the `default` skin from Fossil contributed by Ã‰tienne Deparis.

**Principles:**

- Dark mode. Taking inspiration from other sites' dark modes.
- Stylized.
- But, readable.
- Sober. Since the goal of this skin is to be used for all my projets, I will probably look at it frequently for the following years.
- Use <https://wildbit.com/blog/accessible-palette-stop-using-hsl-for-color-systems> for color design.
